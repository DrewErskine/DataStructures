## Understanding Data Structures

### Collections vs. Maps

- **Collections**: Manage groups of objects as single entities. They are primarily concerned with the storage and retrieval of data as a collection of elements, allowing operations like addition, removal, and iteration.
    - Examples include lists, sets, and queues, each offering different performance characteristics and usage scenarios.

- **Maps**: Associate key-value pairs, facilitating efficient data retrieval through unique keys. They are ideal for scenarios where associative data access is necessary.
    - Variants like `HashMap` and `TreeMap` allow for operations tailored to specific needs, such as order of entry or sorted by natural ordering.

## Collections

Collections in Java provide mechanisms to handle groups of objects. Various types of collections like lists, queues, and sets cater to different needs and data handling strategies.

## Maps

Facilitate efficient data retrieval through unique keys and are particularly useful for high-speed lookups and maintaining insertion order or sorted order.
