# Sets in Java

## Overview

Sets in Java are part of the Collections Framework, designed to store unique elements. Unlike lists, sets do not allow duplicate entries, making them ideal for operations where uniqueness is crucial.

## Implementations

- **HashSet**:
  - Backed by a `HashMap`, `HashSet` offers the best performance for basic operations such as add, remove, and check for existence as long as the hash function disperses the elements properly among the buckets.
  - It does not maintain any order of elements.

- **LinkedHashSet**:
  - Extends `HashSet` but also maintains a linked list of the entries in the order they were inserted, thus providing predictable iteration order.
  
- **TreeSet**:
  - Implements the `SortedSet` interface and maintains elements in a sorted order according to their natural ordering or a specified comparator.
  - It is implemented using a Red-Black tree.

## Use Cases

- **HashSet** is typically used in scenarios where the primary requirement is to maintain a collection of unique items without any specific ordering.
- **LinkedHashSet** is useful when uniqueness and retrieval order (insertion order) are both needed.
- **TreeSet** is ideal for applications that require sorted data access, such as implementing a set sorted by natural ordering or custom comparator.
